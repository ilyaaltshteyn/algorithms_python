Notes to self:
This repo is intended for developing a way to make multiple scans through a Twitter dataset to check for identical and nearly identical tweets. The idea is that the Twitterverse is enormous so it isn't possible to keep all tweets from a massive dataset stored in a multidimensional space easily. But it IS possible to check a given tweet against random selections of the total Twitterverse in a nearest neighbors search. This way, you can get much wider coverage of the Twitterverse when looking for spam, without having to store all tweets and without having to scan all tweets when checking for spam.
